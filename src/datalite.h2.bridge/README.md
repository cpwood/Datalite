# datalite.h2.bridge

This is a Java class that is used to process queries against H2 databases. .NET invokes the class by starting Java as a process. This approach was chosen as it is multi-platform and doesn't require cross-compilation using IKVM.

It works great, however I'm not written any Java since my "hello world" days at uni! So for any Java developers reviewing this code..
